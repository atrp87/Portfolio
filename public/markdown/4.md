I had the opportunity to approach a local gym and propose the idea of creating a website for them. They were interested in the idea and shared their requirements for the website, which included simplicity, ease of navigation, and providing information on schedules, classes, and amenities to attract new members. Throughout the project, I worked closely with the client, conducting regular feedback sessions to ensure that their needs were met.

To begin with, I met with the gym owner to understand their goals for the website, and gathered information on the gym's branding, color scheme, and messaging. After creating a design concept that incorporated these elements, I presented it to the client for feedback. We went through a few rounds of revisions before settling on a final design that was modern, clean, and aligned with the gym's brand.

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I developed the website with a focus on creating a responsive design that was easy to navigate on desktop and mobile devices. The website also included a contact form that was implemented using Formspree, making it easy for potential clients to submit inquiries.

Throughout the project, I maintained open communication with the client, providing regular updates on the project's progress and soliciting feedback during regular check-ins. This allowed us to overcome any challenges and ensure that the final product met the client's needs.

## Client Collaboration

Initial I began the project by meeting with the gym owner to discuss their goals for the website and gather information about the gym's branding, color scheme, and messaging. During this meeting, I asked questions about their target audience, their competitors, how the gym currently attracts new members and promotes their services, and their key messaging. This helped me to get a better understanding of their needs and requirements.

### Design Concept Feedback

After creating a design concept, I presented it to the client for feedback. We had a few rounds of revisions where I made changes to the layout, color scheme, and other elements based on their feedback until we arrived at a final design that met their needs and aligned with their branding.

### Challenges

During the collaboration process, we encountered some challenges that required a productive discussion about the direction of the project.

The client initially requested a simple brochure website but later expressed a desire for a more visually appealing website. While I appreciated the importance of an attractive design, I advised against this change in a manner that respected the client's goals and ideas. At the same time, I expressed my concerns about the potential negative impact on their branding and user experience. While a modern and visually appealing website can be beneficial, it is crucial to ensure that it accurately reflects the brand to avoid mismatched branding, high expectations, and lack of authenticity. Throughout the process, I provided constructive feedback without belittling their business.

Furthermore, we needed to address the client's request to implement a member login functionality on the gym's website, which initially seemed like an appealing idea. I saw this as an opportunity to enhance the gym's services and build my skills in database or cloud storage, while adding new features and tools. However, upon further evaluation, we came to the conclusion that the feature was beyond the scope of the project, given the size of the gym and its limited capacity to accept new members.

Moreover, the gym's communication strategy primarily relied on email and Facebook, and the brand emphasised face-to-face interactions and personal connections with its members. Considering these factors, we made the decision not to proceed with the member login functionality.

Another important factor that contributed to our decision was the existence of a reliable and efficient mobile native booking app, <a

GymSync
</a>, which was already in use and familiar to both clients and members. We believed that introducing a new login system could cause confusion and inconvenience for users, which could have a negative impact on the gym's business.

Throughout the process, I made sure to give my feedback in a professional and considerate manner, with the goal of enhancing the project without diminishing the client's confidence or knowledge in their industry.

### Effective Communication

During the project, I made sure to communicate clearly and effectively with the client. I used simple and easy-to-understand language and provided examples and visuals where necessary. This helped to ensure that the client understood the technical aspects of the project and was able to provide feedback and make decisions based on a clear understanding of the project.

## Exploring Technical Details and Lessons
 
![Javascript.](/src/assets/article/content/omni_gym_details.png)

</section>

### Technical Details

For this project, I opted to use vanilla JavaScript and CSS for several reasons.

- The project had a limited scope, I aimed to keep it lightweight by avoiding any unnecessary dependencies, libraries, or functionalities.

- To consolidate and improve on my skills creating custom solutions and understanding of underlying concepts that will benefit me in future projects.

### Lessons Learned

#### Document Object Model:

- Using traversal methods to locate and navigate individual or groups of elements within the DOM. Using manipulation methods to modify selected elements, event listeners can be incorporated to allow user actions to trigger responses that update the DOM in real-time.

#### Event Delegation:

- Attach an event listener to the parent element instead of attaching listeners to every single child element of the parent element. When an event happens on a child element, the event "bubbles up" to the parent element where the event listener is located.
  Then using the event objects .target property to check which child element triggered the event and performs the necessary action.

#### Client-side Form Validation:

- Verifying the data entered into a form field ensuring that required fields are filled out, validating the format of email the address, postcode and verifying that numeric fields contain only numbers before it is submitted to the server. Providing real-time feedback displaying an error message to the user indicating what they need to correct.

#### Responsive Design & Layouts:

- Designing and developing websites to ensure that they display properly and are usable on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- CSS Grid and Flexbox to design structured layouts with better control over the placement of elements and child elements. Utilising Media Queries to specify different styles for various device sizes.

#### Intersection Observer API:

- Efficiently track and detect changes in the visibility status of an element as it intersects with its root container or the viewport. without the need for continuously checking its visibility status.

- I attached an observer for each core content section element, and when an intersection is detected, I used the entry object properties to check if the target element is intersecting with the viewport. Then, I removed the CSS class section--hidden from the target element's classList, added a transition, and made it visible. Finally, I called the unobserve method on the observer object to stop observing the target element after it has been revealed. This ensures that the observer will not continue to consume resources unnecessarily.

- Similarly I used this functionality for lazy image loading by setting the data-src attribute to the URL of a high-resolution image, while the src attribute was set to a low-resolution version of the same image, so that the low-resolution version can be loaded quickly and the high-resolution version is only loaded when the observer is intersecting.

### Code Example: Navbar ( Event Delegation )

  <Code language="javascript">
    const navbar = document.querySelector('.navbar');
    const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('.nav_links');

    const handleHoverNav = function (e) {
      if (e.target.classList.contains('nav_links')) {

        const link = e.target;
        const siblings = link.closest('.navbar').querySelectorAll('.nav_links');
        const logo = link.closest('.navbar').querySelector('#navbar_logo');

        siblings.forEach(el => {
          if (el !== link) el.style.opacity = this;
        });
        logo.style.opacity = this;

    };
    };

    navbar.addEventListener('mouseover', handleHoverNav.bind(0.5));
    navbar.addEventListener('mouseout', handleHoverNav.bind(1));

  </Code>

I defined a function named <span className='article__content-highlight'>handleHoverNav</span>, passing the event object as a parameter.
Next, I added a <span className='article__content-highlight'>mouseover</span> event to the <span className='article__content-highlight'>navbar</span> element, which triggers the <span className='article__content-highlight'>handleHoverNav</span> function.
Inside the <span className='article__content-highlight'>handleHoverNav</span> function, an <span className='article__content-highlight'>if</span> statement checks if the event target element contains the class name <span className='article__content-highlight'>nav_links</span>. If it does, then it is assigned to a <span className='article__content-highlight'>link</span> variable.

A <span className='article__content-highlight'>siblings</span> variable is assigned the value of all the elements with the class <span className='article__content-highlight'>nav_links</span> that are children of the closest parent element with the class <span className='article__content-highlight'>navbar</span>. Similarly, the <span className='article__content-highlight'>logo</span> variable is assigned the value of the element with an ID of <span className='article__content-highlight'>navbar_logo</span>.

Next, a <span className='article__content-highlight'>forEach</span> method is called on the <span className='article__content-highlight'>siblings</span> NodeList, and for each element that is not the current link element, its opacity is set to <span className='article__content-highlight'>this</span> (referring to the value passed when the <span className='article__content-highlight'>handleHoverNav</span> function is bound to the <span className='article__content-highlight'>mouseover</span> event). The opacity of the logo element is also set to <span className='article__content-highlight'>this</span>.

Another event listener is added to the <span className='article__content-highlight'>navbar</span> element for the <span className='article__content-highlight'>mouseout</span> event, which also triggers the <span className='article__content-highlight'>handleHoverNav</span> function with an opacity value of 1.

When the <span className='article__content-highlight'>handleHoverNav</span> function is bound to the <span className='article__content-highlight'>mouseover</span> event, it is bound with a <span className='article__content-highlight'>this</span> value of 0.5. On the other hand, when it is bound to the <span className='article__content-highlight'>mouseout</span> event, it is bound with a <span className='article__content-highlight'>this</span> value of 1.

## Conclusion

Although not a large project by any means, I gained valuable experience and satisfaction by closely collaborating with my client throughout the project. By actively involving the client in discussions, I was able to leverage my coding skills to transform our collaborative ideas into a tangible, real-world product that met their needs and expectations.

It has allowed me to strengthen my understanding of Javascript fundamentals and provided me with opportunities to explore and experiment with a variety of methods, properties, and concepts that I can apply to future projects or problem-solving scenarios. Additionally, I have gained confidence in my abilities by acknowledging that while I may not remember every single detail, I am able to examine the code and refer to notes or online resources to find the relevant information necessary to address the problem I am currently facing.

Overall, It was a fulfilling experience that expanded my front-end abilities. I look forward to applying what I've learned in future projects.
