This project alwoed me to ( visualy ) see a dseign and layout and turn it into code
I had the opportunity to create a static brochure website for a local gym in Peebles, Scottish Borders. The goal was to create a website that presented key information about the gym in a simple and concise manner, as the demographic for this gym includes people of all ages. The website needed to be easy to navigate, without any unnecessary bulk or complex navigation, so that users could quickly and easily find the information they needed.

The client uses social media, specifically Facebook and Instagram, to promote the gym and generate interest, but they also wanted to have a website where all the information could be found in one place. This would make it easier for potential customers to learn about the gym.

Although a backend for booking time slots was suggested, after careful consideration, the client and I decided to continue using GymSync, the native app that the gym's members were already accustomed to. Moreover, GymSync provides a seamless experience for the members due to its simplicity and being a native application.

Overall, the goal of this project was to create a website that was easy to use and provided all the necessary information about the gym. With a simple and straightforward design, the website presents the gym's key features, classes, and amenities, and provides an easy way to contact the gym or find more information.

## Lessons Learned

  <Code language="javascript">
export const useFetch = (urls) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
  const [isPending, setIsPending] = useState(false)
  const [error, setError] = useState(null)

useEffect(() => {
const controller = new AbortController()

    const fetchData = async () => {
      setIsPending(true)

      try {
        const res = await axios.get(urls, {
          signal: controller
            .signal
        })

        if (!res.data || res.data.length === 0) {
          throw new Error(res.status.text)
        }

        setData(res.data.results.splice(0, 6))
        setIsPending(false)
        setError(null)

      } catch (err) {
        if (err.name === 'AbortError') {
          console.log('the fetch was aborted');
        }
        setError('Could not fetch media list')
        console.log(err.message);
        setIsPending(false)
      }
    }

    fetchData()

    return () => {
      controller.abort()
    }

}, [urls])

return { data, isPending, error }
