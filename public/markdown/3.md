############ Dealing with bugs
############ Taking my time ( as humans always feel like we have to execed our own expectations and it become counter intuative so gave myself permission to take my time and test things, use different resources)
########### Limiting where i pull my information from short visual videos then read and test
########## main goal was async - data manipualtion ( ES6 ) - apis - OTHER ?

This JavaScript project allows users to input the name of a city and displays current weather conditions and a seven-day forecast, all fetched from the open weather API. Users may switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units based on their location or personal preference.

The main objective of this project was to develop a deeper understanding of asynchronous JavaScript, the event loop, HTTP, and web APIs along with their associated concepts and methodologies.

## Technical Details

For this project, I opted to use vanilla JavaScript and CSS for several reasons.

- The project’s scope was on specific core concepts async js engine / concurecny model

- The project’s scope was on specific core concepts so I kept it lightweight, avoiding any unnecessary dependencies, libraries, or functionalities to add unnecessary complexity.

- To consolidate and improve on my skills creating custom solutions and understanding of underlying concepts that will benefit me in future projects.

## Lessons Learned

- <strong>Asynchronous:</strong>

Understanding at its core Javascript is a synchronous language with asynchronous capabilities.

Javascript is single-threaded, statements are executed one after the other and each statement has to wait for the previous one to finish before it can start.

Where we run into problems is when one of these statements takes awhile to complete, in my case fetching data from the open weather API server, Javascript has to wait until the server responds before it can continue executing, blocking operations creating slow unresponsive applications.

To overcome this problem, we can make use of the browsers Web API, that provides features that Javascript doesn’t provide ( I found this very interesting as I presumed these functions were core Javascript ).

Fetch provided a clean way to handle asynchronous operation, its non-blocking allowing the program to continue running while the server processes the request, we specify how the program should proceed in the meantime ( through the use of promises ), such as display a losing spinner or render a message to the user, improving the overall performance and user experience.

- <strong>Promises:</strong>

Understanding Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in a cleaner and more organised way than traditional approaches like callbacks. It’s an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, and can be consumed by other code to handle the result.

Handling Promises states ( pending, fulfilled, rejected ) to manage the outcome of an asynchronous operation depending on its result.

Using async / await as an alternative way to handle promises compared to using .then().
With async/await, you can write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, which can make it easier to read.

- <strong>Event loop:</strong>

  Understanding the event loop is responsible for managing the call stack, the callback queue, and the microtask queue in JavaScript. It ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order and that the application remains responsive.

<section className='article__banner'>
  <Code language="javascript">
const fetchWeatherData = async (cityName) => {
  weatherContent.style.opacity = 0;

try {
displayLoading()

    const currentWeather = await fetch('.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${cityName}&units=${unit}&appid=1234');
    if (!currentWeather.ok) throw new Error('City not found '${cityName}'');
    const currentResponse = await currentWeather.json();

    renderCurrentWeather(currentResponse);
    const { lat, lon } = currentResponse.coord;

    const dailyWeather = await fetch('openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=${lat}&lon=${lon}&units=${unit}&exclude=current,minutely,hourly,alerts&appid=1234');
    if (!dailyWeather.ok) throw new Error('Forecast not found (${dailyWeather.status})');
    const dailyResponse = await dailyWeather.json();

    renderDailyWeather(dailyResponse);

    cta.style.visibility = 'hidden';
    cta.innerHTML = '';
    weatherContent.style.opacity = 1;

} catch (err) {
renderError('${err.message}')

} finally {
hideLoading();
};
};
</Code>

- <strong>Exception Handling:</strong>

I used try-catch statements to handle exceptions gracefully and created custom errors using the built-in error object to reject promises returned by the fetch method when API responses were unsuccessful. By throwing an error, the code stopped and proceeded to the nearest catch block, allowing me to handle the error more effectively.

I also added a finally block to call the hideLoading function, ensuring that the loading user interface remained hidden, regardless of whether the try block succeeded or an error was caught.

## Conclusion

Although not a large project by any means, I gained valuable experience and satisfaction by building a product for someone else, working closely with them to understand their needs and preferences.

It allowed me to refine my skills in key programming languages, explore new knowledge, experiment with different tools and technologies, and discover new concepts and ideas that I can apply to future projects or problem-solving. Overall, it was a fulfilling experience that expanded my horizons as a developer.
